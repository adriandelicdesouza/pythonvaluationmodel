# Automated Stock Valuation with Python

This repository documents my end-to-end journey building Python tools for valuing stocks automatically.

## Skills Being Developed
- Python programming
- Financial statement analysis
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) modeling
- Comparable company valuation
- Financial data automation

## Project Structure

| Phase 1 | Python Foundations | Financial math & core Python |

| Phase 2 | Financial Data | Working with stock datasets |

| Phase 3 | Statements & Ratios | Turning accounting into metrics |

| Phase 4 | DCF Modeling | Intrinsic value calculator |

| Phase 5 | Data Automation | Pulling market data via APIs |

| Phase 6 | Comparables | Relative valuation models |

| Phase 7 | Portfolio Tool | Multi-stock valuation system |

## Final Goal
Build a system that:
- Pulls company financial data
- Calculates intrinsic value
- Compares to market price
- Ranks investment opportunities
